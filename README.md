<span id="installation"></span>
## Installation

Rainbomizer requires an **ASI-Loader** to function. It works with **all** versions of the game. Additionally, you require **ScriptHook** for certain features.

1. Install **ScriptHook** (includes an ASI Loader) from [here](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv)
2. Download Rainbomizer from [Releases](https://github.com/Parik27/V.Rainbomizer/releases) and **extract the archive** to the root directory of GTA V. 

## Configuration

If you wish to change any of the mod's functionalities, for example to disable a specific randomizer, a configuration file (`config.toml`) has been provided with the mod. The config file is located in the `rainbomizer` folder in the game's root directory.

The default configuration file is in the main repository, `config.toml`, and is automatically created by the mod if it doesn't exist in the rainbomizer folder using pre-determined default values.

It can be opened and modified with a text editing program such as Notepad++. Any aspect of the mod can be modified to your liking using this file - if you make changes while the game is running, the game must be restarted for these to take effect.

- To enable or disable a certain randomizer, set the corresponding value to "true" or "false" from the list of randomizers at the top of the file.   
- To configure a certain randomizer, find its specific section in the file by searching for its name. If there isn't a specific section, the randomizer doesn't offer further customization. More information about how to configure specific randomizers is provided in the default config file.
