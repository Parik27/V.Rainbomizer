You fool!
You idiot! 
Too tough for you?
How did you manage that?
That was the absolute worst performance I've ever seen.
Is this your first time playing this game? Looks like it.
I hate to tell you this, but that sucked.
That was awful.
Only someone very special could fail like that.
Do you understand how to operate these controls? Do you need an adult?
Pro Tip: Complete the mission objectives properly to not lose.
All you had to do was pass the damn mission.
Aw shit, here you go again.
I can't say I've ever seen someone fail like that before, I'll be honest.
That's a good candidate for a Top GTA V Fails video.
Oh, is it too hard for you? Too hard? TOO BAD!
Perhaps you should consider using cheat codes.
You must have done that on purpose, right? How else could you have failed so badly?
At this rate, you'll be lucky to finish this game before human life ceases to exist.
There were so many things wrong with what you just did that I'm not even sure where to begin.
What kind of player are YOU anyway...?!
Rockstar would like you to know that after seeing that, they have revoked your permission to continue playing this video game. Please close it now and never touch it again, for everyone's sake.
I believe people these days would call that a rather small brained move.
You talk a big game but you certainly don't bring it.
You've got some little bitty chiquita cojones.
Man, you're a buster.
Always letting the homies down, eh?
Absolute garbage.
Absolutely terrible performance.
I'm sorry to inform you that
