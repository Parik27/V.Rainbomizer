# Rainbomizer Data Files

A list of data files used by Rainbomizer to help with easily updating them without having to recompile the ASI.

## Model File Format

Used for `CutsceneModelsProps.txt`, `CutsceneModelsPeds.txt` and `WeaponModels.txt`

The file is a list of model names sorted into groups separated by empty lines. A model will only be randomized by other models present in the same group.

```
a
b
c

d
e
f
```
For example, this file would have 2 groups (a, b and c) and (d, e and f). When the model `b` is to be randomized, it'll only be randomized into `a` or `b`.

## Weapon Weights Format

Weapon Weights follow a simple pattern - 

```
weapon = weight
```

If the file exists, only weapons listed in the file will be considered for randomization.
